Added routing to a Codecademy Pet Adoption React App


For this Codecademy challenge, I was tasked with adding Routing to an exisiting React app. This build used an older version of React Router (v5), which is different than the V6 I've used in the past.

To create fully functional single page routing, I used the `react-router-dom` library with such components as `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, `Switch`, `useLocation()`, `useHistory()`, `useParams()`, `NavLink`, and `Link`.

I enjoyed this activity as it was different from my previous experiences adding Routing to an app. I appreciate V6 more after using this version and I look forward to learning more about Routing as I get more practice with React.
